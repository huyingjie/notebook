* make sure that you develop tolerance for failure

## goals


* May create unnecessary stress and pressure

	You have to understand how things work. You have a target and a deadline to hit, you somehow created stress and pressure within you.

	For some, the stress and pressure are good. They become the driving force that motivates them to achieve more.
	
	On the other hand, for those who don’t know how to handle the stress and pressure, setting goals make them procrastinate even more. They feel uneasy and things may crumble in their world.
	
	Hence, it depends on your own interpretation of the pressure you had on you.

	为了减少pressure => set goals => increase pressure

	* more goals more Procrastination

* 没有实现目标 to Diminish your Confidence = Sense of Failure

	Although achieving your goals or objectives can give you a sense of boost in your confidence, but not able to meet the set goals also makes one feel a whole lot of awful about themselves. If one doesn’t complete the set goals he may consider himself unworthy because all he did was work towards these goals and so the sense of failing could hit harder than he can imagine.
	
* ignorant to other aspects of your life including your health, personal and social life

* Blinded you with other opportunities
You see, when you set a goal, you put all your energy and focus on that goal. You become less open to other opportunities and possibilities.
 
 * Become result-focused rather than progress-focused
 * Research by Maurice Schweitzer and colleagues shows that individuals who have specific goals are four times as likely to overstate their performance, essentially to lie about their performance, compared to individuals that don't have specific goals. Such as those that have a do your best type of goal. 
 * <font color="blue">Goals can be mutually reinforcing and then you're in luck. But they can be in direct conflict with one another. So for example, if I have a goal of increasing sales and another goal of decreasing advertising budget, those two goals can be in conflict with each other. 

 	这个才是我在现实生活中感觉到的

 * narrow our attention focus too much sometimes. So we're missing the most blatant, obvious things around us.

 	 So at some point, you might consider relaxing the specificity condition. So I'll give you a specific example. When we ask people to proofread a document for grammatical errors, they're very good at detecting grammatical errors, but they're completely oblivious to blatant content errors. When we ask people to just proofread the document in general, they're equally good at catching grammatical errors, but they're also very good at detecting content errors.
 	 
 	 **So think about relaxing the specific condition if you're concerned that a very, very specific goal can narrow people's attention too much. **
 	 
 * **specific goals can constrain our learning and creativity**

 	That is especially true for those environments that are complex. That are poorly understood. Where you have a wide choice of decision-making strategists on the way to accomplishing a particular goal. That's when specific goals can really backfire. 
 	
 *  Spiritual Starvation

	Another danger of goal setting is that if you go overboard with achieving your goals, then you can experience a sense of spiritual void or starvation, or a sense of emptiness or loss of meaning and purpose in your life. This is interesting because isn’t goal setting supposed to be about increasing meaning and purpose in our lives? If you are filling every last minute and hour of your days or weeks with achieving your goals, and you’re feeling as though something is missing, then you should double check how much down time you’re giving to yourself.
