title: Maladaptive Daydreaming
description:

## Definition


**Daydreaming Disorder (MD)**: Official name of **Maladaptive Daydreaming**; Extensive fantasy activity that replaces human interaction and/or interferes with academic, interpersonal, or vocational functioning. See also Compulsive Fantasy, Maladaptive Daydreaming

## Symptom


1. Daydreaming excessively in a way that is often compared to an addiction.
2. This excessive daydreaming often begins in childhood.
3. Books, movies, music, video games, and other media may be a daydreaming trigger.
4. The daydreaming itself is often detailed and elaborate, sometimes compared to a movie or nove

5. Repetitive movements while daydreaming are common (but not always present in sufferers) — pacing, rocking, spinning, shaking something in their hand, etc.

	* talk,
	* laugh,
	* cry
	* gesture
	* make facial expressions as they daydream. 
	* Some people will lie in bed for hours daydreaming, and may either have difficulty going to sleep because of this, or have difficulty getting out of bed once awake.  They may also neglect basic functions such as regular meals, etc. because of excessive daydreaming.

6. They may sometimes talk, laugh, cry, gesture, or make facial expressions as they daydream. People suffering from this know the difference between daydreaming and reality, and do not confuse the two; this makes them distinctly different from psychotics or schizophrenics.
7. Some people will lie in bed for hours daydreaming, and may either have difficulty going to sleep because of this, or have difficulty getting out of bed once awake. They may also neglect basic functions such as regular meals, showering, and other daily activities because of their daydreaming.

经常走神，一天有一大半的时间在自己的脑海中幻想各种故事和场景。不论是在上课还是和朋友出去玩。有时真的影响到了自己的生活，因为难以集中注意力到自己的工作学习中。但幻想真的很爽……可以逃避现实。


对一件事情的热情在脑子里耗完了，现实中就很难坚持什么。

长期耗费脑力，现在注意力很难长时间集中，每天疲惫浑噩。

幻想症让我不自觉地喜欢撒谎，没办法接受满足当下的样子。没办法有深度的思考。甚至让我产生虚假的连自己都骗过去了的感情。那就是根本不爱却编的天花乱坠让自己都信了。

千万不要去思考形而上学或者存在主义这些容易让人变成神经病的东西，真的不要。你会后悔的。想太多真的会死人。

一个人越孤独、对生活越不满意、得到的社会支持越少，可能就越容易做白日梦。

MD has really made it significantly more difficult for me to 

* focus
* concentrate
* motivated = work towards aspirations in real life
* hard to learn and grow

谎言: lie on myself by escaping and think that everything is ok

失掉工作

**Everything happening in my future was the opposite of what I wanted. MD filled my head with many lies. **

结果

![](测试结果.jpg)

## 与好的day dream的区别

在白日梦的内容方面，MD患者与正常人之间的差异是：MD患者的白日梦更加精彩，有虚构人物和精心设计的情节，经常发生在不同的时间段或使用特定的虚构体裁（如卡通、科幻），而正常人的白日梦似乎是基于现实或愿望实现，通常没有虚构人物，而是身边熟悉的人，或者他们自己。MD患者中幻想更具娱乐性和创造性，这可能有助于解释为什么这种白日梦的方式更令人愉快，也更难抑制。

MD患者的白日梦的深度和淹没性更强，他们似乎有能力完全沉浸在一个白日梦世界中，这是一种在另一个自我描述的世界中获得存在感的能力，它是如此的引人注目，以至于难以戒除。一位MD患者经常会对自己说：“我最后一次再幻想一下吧，明天开始就彻底戒掉”。

一位MD患者总结了这样的恶性循环：糟糕的现状——幻想的满足——现实更糟糕——幻想的满足并逃离现实——幻想失控并带来更加糟糕的现实——痛苦甚至绝望——继续幻想......看来，通过幻想来解决现实压力，正如通过酒精或游戏成瘾来逃避现实一样，最终会成为一种无法摆脱的心理症状。

## Trigger

* 音乐 <font color="blue">我的trigger</font>
* 需要等待 <font color="blue">我的trigger</font>
* 游戏
* 电影  <font color="blue">电影无聊的时候, 我的trigger</font>
* 电视剧
* 漫画
* 在用脑一段时间后会出现幻想，有时候能陷进去数十分钟
* 焦虑感增加的时候，强迫幻想也会加重。

	焦虑情绪其实是人的一种保护机制，它能够让人意识到潜在危险的存在，并及时做出应对。焦虑在人类社会是普遍存在的，但问题在于，有一些人长期处于焦虑水平，并且一直以来也没有找到一种合适的方式去释放和调整这种焦虑。所以，幻想，就成了他们用来缓解心理不适应的“药物”，并且因为长期如此，已经产生了“药物依赖”，一旦“停药”，就会产生戒断反应，使得心理不适应的程度加剧。

	I've recently set some huge academic and social goals for myself, but every time I try thinking about the goals, and more specifically, the amount of work I'll need to put in, I start daydreaming. I think the daydreaming in this case is serving as a mechanism to cover the discomforts of real life.
* 感到自卑的时候, experience mood dips and low self-esteem

	低自尊的人群非常容易对外界表现出退缩和回避。有一些人会有些社交焦虑，喜欢蜷缩在自己的壳子里，减少社交活动与他人的接触。而这时，因为他们大多数时候是独处的，如果他们没有一个能够让自己投入精力的兴趣爱好，他们就只好把精力投放到自己身上。
	
	强迫型幻想的内容基本上围绕自己的，因为低自尊的人群总是需要通过他人的认可来使自己得到满足，可现实中的自己“处处碰壁”，似乎得不到他人的关心和喜爱，所以在幻想中的自己一定要足够美好，足够被人喜欢。
	
	仔细想一想，幻想的内容基本都用于突出主角的各种美好品质，我是不会幻想自己一无是处、好吃懒做的，因为这样的品质不会得到他人的认可。


* insular/solitude people

	traditionally enjoyed staying in our own heads and generally enjoy our own company.

	=> However, with the introduction of maladaptive daydreaming all of that changes. It no longer feels productive or enjoyable to stay in one's own mind.

	Instead it feels like we're wasting our life because our maladaptive daydreams have nothing to do with our own life and we're now choosing our maladaptive daydreams over doing nearly anything in our real life.

* trauma, including escape/avoid

	If you want to escape from something, then it might as well be considered traumatic. Whether that's a job, a relationship, a school experience, or something entirely different.
Escapism is a manner in which trauma is avoided (whatever that trauma may be) and maladaptive daydreaming is the mechanism by which that escapism occurs.
As I' ve said for the past few years, the way to overcome maladaptive daydreaming is by first recognizing what it is. When you recognize it' s purely a form of escapism – a safe fantasy your mind has dreamt up – then the first crack has been made.


## Bad Outcome

影响到自己生活 = 逃避现实压力 (社交，生活，工作，学习)

原理: 花大量的时间在daydream上 + daydream与现实无关 => 在幻想中真的很快乐很满足 => 增加在daydream里的时间 => 减少花在现实生活中的时间 => unproductive and can actually be an extreme hindrance to their everyday lives


## Treatment

1. Avoiding Triggers
	隔绝trigger3个月, 期间与别人疯狂聊天来排解苦闷
	
	<font color="blue">
	* 看音乐剧的clip
	* 看音乐的MV
	* 看阿云嘎, 云次方, 梅溪湖的视频
	</font>
	
	It's strongly suggested that you figure out exactly what triggers you to daydream, and then avoid or limit those activities if at all possible.  You could actually make a list of all your triggers and then work to avoid them.  Instead of “feeding” your daydreams in this way, use this freed-up time to focus on your real life and real surroundings.

	Some people have actually tried going on a partial or total **“media fast”** avoiding all media as much as possible.  As someone said on one of our forums, “Most MD'ers tend to find 'triggers' in the media, such as internet browsing, television, books, video games and music, and limiting the use of these mediums may help. It's a benefit to helping attention problems as well, considering the 'rapid pacing' of these mediums and how they seem to exacerbate attention problems.”


2. 使用Extraverted Thinking 来制作todo list, 然后根据list 来做事情

	stay busy and focused on my life as much as possible

	Avoid Procrastination:

	You do have a real life, and actual things that need to be accomplished in that life.  Strive to do the real life things that you need to do, and plan for things that you need to accomplish in your real future.  Try to avoid putting things off that need to get done.  You could try making a weekly list of things that you need to do, and that are reasonable and attainable, then work to accomplish those goals.  Praise yourself every time you check something off the list!  I think that most of us who suffer from this have trouble with procrastinating and doing real life things, including myself, so count as a victory every little move forward. 

	Some people may want to make a deal with themselves; if they finish certain tasks, they will give themselves some free daydreaming time (with a DEFINITE start and finish time.) Other people may find that this is a bad idea for them. Perhaps a better plan would be to reward yourself with an enjoyable real life activity instead. You have to experiment and see what works best for YOU.


3. Take Care of Yourself:

	It' s easy for people suffering with this illness to ignore or neglect their body and health.  I know from personal experience that those of us with MD can be so focused on our fantasy life and body that we ignore our real needs, real life, and actual physical body.  I now suffer fro	m a chronic health condition that I ignored for years (and that worsened for years)  before I got any help, mostly because I was not really bothering to focus on my real health and body. Please don't let this happen to you.  

	It' s very important to get enough sleep every night, eat regular, healthful meals, exercise if possible, and promply attend to any physical problems that you may have.  You will feel better, and also be actively focusing on your real life and body - as you should be. 

4. 花更多的时间社交，如果你讨厌社交，就找亲近的朋友或者家人交流。
5. 参加户外活动，感受真实的生活。

1. understanding the root of your maladaptive daydreams. 

	* How did they occur? 
	* what do they represent? 
	* what are they preventing you from confronting?

	
1. Reality Check:

	When you start daydreaming or are tempted to do so, occasionally <font color="blue">remind yourself that the daydreams are NOT reality</font>.  This seems obvious, but it is actually very helpful to sometimes stop yourself when daydreaming and say to yourself, “No, I' m not a TV star or rock singer, and no, I' m not rich and famous.  That is NOT the real me, or my real life.”

	I'm sure that some of you will experience this as a letdown, but it's important for all of us who suffer from this to remember that no matter how enjoyable our daydreams are, they ARE NOT REAL. I know it's hard to back away from the seductive world of daydreaming, but it's important to remind yourself that when you're in love with your daydreams, you' re in love with…..NOTHING. 

1. Avoid Self Hatred:

	I suffered with MD for many, many years before I was aware that there was anyone else out there like me.  For a long time, I used to have a LOT of self hatred because of this illness. This was made worse because my mind tends to constantly weave daydreams as I go through my day, and I will quite often be daydreaming for a while before I catch myself doing it. I hated myself so much for this, and could not forgive myself for not being “normal.”  I ultimately realized that that kind of attitude is extremely self-destructive, counter-productive, and worse than useless. 
	
	**Please keep in mind that this is an illness just like OCD, Bipolar Disorder, or any other mental health problem.  There is still a great deal of stigmas on such disorders, and this is very unfortunate.**
	
	This problem is really no different from any of the above issues, or even different from having diabetes, arthritis, or any other physical malady. It is simply an illness that needs to be dealt with.
	
	Remind yourself of this if you find yourself falling into patterns of self hatred:  you did NOT ask for this problem, and you did NOT choose to have it.  Forgive yourself for not being “perfect” or “normal.”  Be gentle and loving with yourself as you work to deal with this issue, the same as you would to a good friend who came to you with this problem.


1. Withdrawal Symptoms:

	Some people on our forums have stated that they have experienced some emotional withdrawal symptoms when they try to lessen or stop daydreaming. People have mentioned such symptoms as anxiety, depression, a feeling of emptiness, changes in sleep patterns, etc. You may or may not experience this, however, daydreaming is by definition an escape from reality. By removing that activity, feeling, thoughts, and issues that have not been dealt with may rise to the surface and now need to be faced and worked through. Please consider both therapy and medication if you find it hard to cope without daydreaming in your life. Both of these things have been very helpful to me. At the very least, be aware that this could initially happen when you start to control your daydreaming, and be prepared to work through it. 

1. Forums:

	You might find it helpful to join one of the forums for this issue.  There are a lot of other people out there who suffer from this. People on these sites compare stories, and ideas on how to control Maladaptive Daydreaming.  When I read through the posts, I’m always amazed at how our experiences sound so much alike.  You might make some friends and can compare notes with others who will understand exactly how you feel. Here are some forums:

1. Therapy

	* therapy for dissociative disorders could be helpful for this problem.  Here is a list of possible treatment options that I have compiled.
	* CBT

1. Socialize/ Hang out with friends:  Many people with this problem will fantasize much less when surrounded by other people. If you think that this might work for you, it could be very helpful, as it obviously also involves participating in your real life and real surroundings.

1. Creative Activity: Several people have reported that they lessen the desire to daydream by channeling their creativity into** writing, drawing, acting**, etc. Patient "X" in Dr. Schupak's original article felt that engaging in creative activities, such as acting in plays, suppressed her daydreaming significantly. Another person claimed to control MD completely by writing down and drawing pictures of her daydreams.  On the other hand, some people (including myself) may experience some of these activities as trigger inducing. By trial and error, find out what works for you.

1. The Buddy System: A few people on MD forums have made friends with other Maladaptive Daydreamers, offering support to each other as they work to deal with this issue.  Certainly no one else will understand what you are going through like another MD sufferer. Obviously, I would recommend putting limits on how much personal/contact information you give someone you don't know.
2. journal

	Write in it whenever you feel the urge to daydream no matter how many pages it takes. If you are somewhere away from your journal, get a blank piece of paper and write/draw whatever you feel comfortable writing or drawing where you are. Try to keep logs of how long you have gone without daydreaming here. For instance, if you cave and daydream one day put a star next to the date so you can restart your count and don’t get too frustrated with yourself. Thats about all I have to say about the journal method. (;
	
	
3. "cut-down" instead of "cut-out"

4. Meditation:  Several people have suggested and used meditation as a way to focus and quiet the mind. 

4.  一个常年幻想者的强迫性幻想和注意力不集中状态很可能不止是纯心理问题，而是已产生了神经方面的变化，负责幻想的神经功能过于强大，负责阅读、思考等功能的神经变弱。  
 解决方法：空闲时间大量阅读和思考。 注意是阅读理论性书籍，而不是文学作品。安排一些思考练习题，要那种逻辑的有序的思考，而不是发散的直觉的瞎j8想。偶尔做做数学题也行。  一开始肯定会费劲，过程中各种走神，产生挫败感。但一定要坚持，明白这个痛苦过程也是改善过程，像锻炼肌肉时的酸痛感一样，不是无意义的受苦。  
 
 志同道合啊，我在了解到大脑具有可塑性这一事实后，就觉得自己因为从小的幻想让自己幻想相关的功能区异常活跃，而且形成了一种持久的状态，或者说一种习惯，并且启动这个惯常行为的诱导因素随着不断的积累，变得越来越多，以至于隔三差五就进入幻想。我后来也发现用理性思考方式来代替感性的幻想很有用，我更是发现，将思维角度从第三人称切换到第一人称，能更快的找回自我。

## Theory? 


theorists have also attributed MD to dissociative personality disorder, because with such disassociation, the person is often similarly detached from his or her immediate surroundings in both the physical and emotional aspect.

总结

* 小时候开始: 初中升高中的暑假
* 影响学业: 注意力不集中
* 成绩下降
* 记忆力变差

</font>

> 你和我一样，我也是有这种病十年了，也是原生家庭的原因，初中毕业的那个暑假，我在农村，家里啥也没有，我父母也不让我干别的，我就去幻想，当时还不习惯幻想，我还强制把自己拉进虚拟世界，后来就习惯了虚拟世界，再回到现实世界已经很难了，现在已经十多年了，很难受

与我的经历好像

> 我的情况基本上一模一样，从记事起就开始了。读书的时候还好，因为有强制上课和各种活动，但是个人体会幻想症最大的问题就是走出校园之后，真的完全脱离控制了，如果再配合拖延和轻微社恐简直就是……

我出国后加重的

> 喜欢独处，社恐，健忘 我觉得真的是幻想症后遗症。
> 特别有的时候尤其是早上起床会觉得毫无动力，感觉对一切都没什么兴趣……但沉浸在想法里的时候情绪又很激动，一激动完又陷入对世界没爱的压抑里，哎…怀疑自己是不是还有点燥郁。成绩现在直线下滑，绝望（´д｀）
> 我也是老是幻想啊，有时还一直回想原来发生的不开心的事，导致我无法集中精力去学习，现在成绩在一点点下降，真的特别无助，怎么办(⊙o⊙)！

构建一个有利的幻想世界

> 国外有一名法学MD患者，通过幻想各种案例，让自己学会了法学...要不要试试看这个方法？构建一个对现实状况有利的幻想世界？？？

我感觉这是天生带的，我小时候（4.5岁）从看第一部动画片第一个芭比电影开始，我就已经有这种幻想了 。小时候无聊，所以有很多时间想。
后来，小学事情变多了，常常没时间想，所以特别喜欢睡觉前的一段时间，因为放空状态下，这是我一天中唯一的幻想时间。
后来，初中开始好好学习，但是特别生气的是无法集中注意力，记忆力没有影响，最重要的是注意力。注意力太发散了，不自主的被迫走神，等老师讲完题你才回过神来。所以大量上补习班。
高中，更痛苦了。注意力的分散超出我的预想，我只好用写笔记的方式控制走神，老师说什么我记什么，全班只有我一个人在写写写，老师同学常常劝我不要写那么多笔记，这样影响听课效率，什么学霸从来不记那么多笔记之类的。我被说服过一段时间，没有写那么多，结果是疯狂的走神幻想，但是那时候我根本没有想到我跟大家是不一样的。
现在大学，我终于知道了。其实，也有想过放弃这种幻想，但是舍不得。我从四岁就开始构建的世界，那么多年了，实在是舍不得。现在我姑且把这种幻想看作是创造灵泉的天赋，本质上的确是一种天赋。
这么多年，除了朋友，即使一个人时也乐的其所，因为我可以幻想。
吃饭的时候想，走路的时候想，睡觉前想……无时无刻
如果未对来还有阻碍的话，到时候我会自行铲除的。

我也因为创伤有过这样

> 我的情况好像和大家的有一点细微不一样。我从小就还蛮喜欢幻想的，但是没有影响生活和学习，这种幻想走向“失控”好像是从五年前开始，感觉一开始是有一个类似创伤性的事件，然后我开始不断地反刍我所经历的事情，在幻想里修改它的细节，直到我在自己的幻想里从弱势的一方变成一个超然的不好欺负的不会“输”的形象，或者是在脑海里一遍一遍地预演第二天要面对的让我焦虑的人和事。那段时间伴有一定程度的抑郁，学习什么的不停地走神，上课也走神，考试也走神，注意力和记忆力都变差了，然后又不停地惩罚自己，还蛮痛苦的。后来不觉得抑郁了，但是幻想的习惯还是一直保留着，我也没怎么当回事，觉得就是我思维太跳跃太散漫了。
我目前倒是没有一个幻想出来的缤纷异世界，我的幻想很现实很功利，我是会不停幻想自己的人生未来某天功成名就万人追捧接受采访……然后我的幻想基本上都是我衣冠楚楚正襟危坐拿着麦克风，很从容地表达着自己，关于寒门出身我是如何成功的（会说到落泪），关于我是这么看待一些社会现象的，关于我对青年朋友们的寄语。我真是服了。现实生活里不是特别爱说话善于表达的人，在幻想里一不注意脑子里就开始出采访发言稿，情真意切感人肺腑深刻隽永意味悠长那种，服了服了，我都快在幻想里把我的自传出完了。
>
>本来还没觉得怎么样，这几天我赶一个ddl就发现离谱，我还有四天要交读书报告我到现在书都没看完，急到这个地步了我还是会在看到某一句话的时候就跌入幻想里面去，然后那 句 话 会 变 成 我 的 发 言 稿 OTZ
>
> 经常因为“深夜采访”而休息不好……昨天晚上因为幻想不断入侵大脑，通宵没睡着，终于觉得不对劲了。
> 

我也是暑假的时候这样

> 记得初中高中放寒暑假，在家里无所事事的时候，我就会经常幻想，有时一天四五个小时很正常，那时候还担心自己是否会得精神病。哈哈。我发现听音乐特别容易促发幻想，最好还是把这个促发机制给切断了，不要听音乐。我现在工作了好多年，虽然心智成熟了，但是无所事事的时候，有时还是会幻想，就是感觉很爽，跟吸毒一样，特别满足。我一直想要克服这个毛病，是觉得这个坏习惯会影响我的自信和精神状态，其实它就很懒惰和拖延症一样的，不严重的话，无伤大碍。如果非常严重，比方说学习时间段，一天8个小时之内都喜欢幻想的话，那就要好好克服一下了。大家并不孤单，有一群人和你们战斗，加油啊

## 经验

第一条经验，不要把因为幻想而苦恼的事情向没有经过认真考量的人诉说，尤其是自己最亲近的人。如果他们不能体会自己的痛苦并给出实用的建议，其实不需要让他们知道太多。一方面，我们会不自觉的加高对他们的期盼，当他们即使是不小心做了和别人一样的对我们有伤害的事（比如没有理解我们的痛苦），对我们造成的伤害的程度完全不是一个级别，并且越亲近，伤害越大。另一方面，如果他们没办法帮到我们，告诉他们也不过是徒增一份痛苦罢了，实在是不必。你可以直接告诉他们你需要什么，而不是去诉说痛苦。而且，与其找亲近的人诉说，不如去找专业的心理咨询师给你的帮助更大。但是，记住，要是专业的，专业的，专业的。

怎样的人才算是经过认真考量的人，我觉得，TA得是能帮上你的，你信任的人。选的时候，要慎重，还要做好不被理解的准备。如果TA帮到你了，那恭喜你，你很幸运。如果TA没有，不要生气，不要失望，不要感到受挫，我们还有自己。

> 看到胜利的曙光后，我开始制定具体的目标和计划去学习，转移注意力嘛，况且，当时是高三。但是问题又出现了。我在每次给自己定了具体的目标和计划后，都会产生一种错觉，就是，目标和计划定完了，我就已经完成目标和计划了，大概是脑补能力太强？继而我会不自觉放松下来，陷入幻想。所以，我的几乎所有目标和计划，都夭折了。是的，夭折，越具体的（例如每天背几个单词，在几号之前背完多少个）夭折的越快，甚至于，刚诞生就死亡。直到后来，我不给自己定目标了，每天空闲时间就背，也不管背多少个，也没有数量要求，只是背。这样效果反而比定计划和目标来的更实在。我知道，这样不如有详细计划并且能认真落实的大神们对整体情况的掌控，但对我来说，这是更适合我的方法，至少现阶段来说是这样。

> 我现在是自己出来住，一个人自习，一个人买菜做饭，一个人跟自己对抗。在跟自己战斗到精疲力尽的时候，没有人可以安慰我，我也从不把这些事跟爸妈说。一方面是他们理解不了我的情况，是的，是“理解不了”，而不是“不理解”，这么简单。另一方面我向往高飞，父母希望我安稳。如果我说了这些，他们会说，你就回来别那么辛苦了。只是，在20岁的时候就安稳下来了，漫长的一生也就会像一片死水了吧。没有任何轨迹外的可能性，一眼望到尽头。所以在他们面前，我永远是独立，能自己照顾好自己，快乐，努力，上进，勤奋的样子。我坚强的后盾，我不能倚靠，还需要我花费为数不多的正能量扮演着快乐的自己。      累。    没关系，他们放心我，就好了。我总是这么安慰自己。
> *看着那些在自习室能全身心学习的人，我很羡慕，羡慕到嫉妒。像我这样，失去了努力的能力的人，这样连为了过自己喜欢生活而努力的能力都没有的人，是不是被剥夺了追求幸福的权利呢。是啊，连努力的能力都没有了。注定，没有机会过上自己喜欢的生活了吧。     收拾东西，走人，漫无目的地溜达，看着路上的人，觉得自己仿佛
> **多与自己的现实世界接触。自己的家人，自己的工作，自己的吃喝拉撒，衣食住行。     电影、音乐、小说、电视剧，这些有虚构世界的东西，尽量少接触。甚至说，知乎上那些讲别人的故事的，朋友圈晒各种的，别人生活里的东西，尽量不要去看。至少，现在的我们，不适合去看那些。我们自己的现实世界比较脆弱，这时候去看那些是对我们自己现实世界的冲击。现在我们要做的是把我们自己的现实世界培养长大，让它变稳固，变得对我们自己有吸引力。**   总是向往那些虚幻的世界，别人的世界，自己的现实世界没有我们的投入，互动，会萎缩也是不可避免的吧。   我们的现实世界需要他们的主人，我们也需要我们自己的现实世界来成为真正的自己，而不是那个世界里模糊不清的人。   可以去交个朋友，不谈心，只是一起吃饭，聊一些生活中浅显的话题，一起逛街；还可以找个同行的人，不谈心，只是约时间一起学习，一起工作，自己做自己的事情，但又不是自己孤身一人。    不要问我，为什么要强调 不谈心 。这只是我的想法，建议。
> 

> 睡前和走路时不是容易做白日梦吗？找有声理论书籍或英语单词听，强行制造出另一个可供注意力集中的点。找不到资源的话讯飞有声了解一下，直接把普通电子书变成有声书，机械腔不重听着不算太突兀。  
> 考虑一下要不要把手机里的音乐软件卸了，我发现不止我一个听音乐时特容易做白日梦的，或者说音乐根本就是白日梦的春药（雾），有时借口听音乐其实必然会开始不由自主地做白日梦。

## 7 steps to stop daydreaming

1. Identify why you daydream = trigger

	The first step to stopping something from happening is to understand why it's happening in the first place. You can discern the root cause of your daydreaming by analyzing the content of your daydreams and answering honestly with yourself about how and why you fantasize. Some people daydream to avoid painful thoughts or feelings, others suffer from anxiety or insecurity and get caught up in imagining a perfect world. Think about what you daydream about most frequently, and try to identify what about that situation is causing you to check out. Then, you can work on tackling the problem head-on and taking action to change your situation, rather than escaping it.

2. Know your patterns.

	Start to notice when your mind gets the urge to drift off, and what causes that urge. If you can identify your triggers — the actions or events that cause you to daydream — you can better prepare for them. Do you only fantasize when you're bored, or does it happen mostly when you're upset? Once you recognize a pattern in your behavior, you can take action to avoid daydreaming as the response. If you fantasize when you're upset, you can have a plan for the next time you feel that way, with a list of alternative ways to cope with your emotions.

3. Keep your mind busy.

	Especially if you fantasize when you're bored, keeping your mind busy can be a productive way to avoid getting your head stuck in the clouds. Consider making a simple to-do list to keep track of the things you need to do, and work your way through the list meticulously, referring back to it when you get the urge to drift off.

4. Meditate.

	Meditation is the ultimate exercise in keeping your mind in check. It's a hard thing to do, but keeping your mind free and your thoughts passive will give you a greater control over your mind's impulses. It will also ground you in the moment and cause you to be more present. Start small, with a couple of minutes a day, and build up from there. If you work best with guidance or a prompt, download a guided meditation app or find a video that works for you.

5. Ground yourself in the present.

	You can counteract your tendency to be in your head by grounding yourself in your surroundings. Train yourself to be present more often by using grounding techniques: name and identify some of the objects in the room you're in, or focus on some tangible activity you can do there. You can also focus on your breath and the mechanics of breathing. These actions can help put you back in reality; if you feel yourself drifting off, pause what you're doing for a couple of minutes and try some of these exercises.

6. Turn your daydreaming into visualization.

	Again, not all daydreaming is bad; it can be a useful and productive tool if used positively toward a goal. Maladaptive daydreaming and visualization are actually not that far apart from each other, and it only takes a few tweaks to turn your fantasies into positive projections into the future. Visualization is the act of taking a perspective on your life from outside of yourself and motivating yourself toward your ideal reality. In order to practice this form of modified daydreaming, set a clear time, place, and goal for your visualization. The main difference between the two practices is intention. Have awareness about what your intentions are, and how you will achieve them.

7. Take steps toward your goals.

	Visualizing an ideal future for yourself is only the first step in getting fully out of your daydreaming pattern. Again, we daydream to escape reality, because reality is often difficult, tedious and labor-intensive. But in order to get where you want to be – in the fantasy on the other side of your daydreams — you need to take concrete steps to change your reality. Using visualization as a tool, turn your dreams into tangible goals, and begin to make a plan to work toward them.
